# BackupBash
This is a project for partition backup ext4 under linux

To make this backup, there's a handy tool available: the dump and restore programs. These two commands operate at device level in block mode, but can still restore individuals.

For some time now, no one has been responsible for their maintenance in the linux world.

As a result, these commands no longer appear in distributions. The latest version of the source code is available and can be installed after compilation. 

It is also possible to use cpio (preferably) or tar archivers to make backups.
